# Introduction to Python: 
## Day 1: 
### What is Python?:
Python is an interpreted language. This means that a new executable file is created when you run your code. The next time that you execute your code, this new executable file is run instead of the original file.
It is a relatively simple language that includes a standard library that provides modules for a large number of processes that programs deal with. This approach keeps Python simple yet reliable programming language. Python has an easy-to-use syntax that is focused on the programmer who must type in the program, read what was typed, and provide formal documentation for the program. Python strikes a good balance between fast compilations and readability, and it is easier to write applications.
Python is implemented in C and relies on the extensive, well understood, portable C libraries. It fits seamlessly with UNIX, Linux, and POSIX environments. Since these standard C libraries are widely available for the various MS-Windows variants, and other non-POSIX operating systems, Python runs similarly in all environments. The Python programming language was created based on lessons learned during language and operating system support. Python is built from concepts in the ABC and Modula-3 languages.
### Comments in Python: 
Comments are added to make the source code easier to understand. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. 
### Creating Applications using Python: 
 Indentation in Python identifies what code belongs to what section of code.
 ### Escape Sequences: 
* Backslash character (\):  e.g \\
* New line feed: \n
* Tab: \t
* Vertical tab: \v
* Backspace: \b
* Carriage return: \r
* Single quote (useful in strings enclosed in single quotes: ‘hello \ ‘World’): \\'
* Double quote (useful in strings enclosed in single quotes: “hello \ “World”): \\"


### Reserved words in Python:
NB: Cannot be used as ordinary identifiers, must be spelled *EXACTLY* as wriiten here:
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass

# Python 3.5 keywords (added 'async', 'await', 'asynchronous', 'contextlib', 'async for', 'async with')
async      await      async def  async for  async with
asynchronous contextlib

# Python 3.6 keywords (added 'f' for formatted string literals)
f          False      async      await      True

# Python 3.7 keywords (added 'async' and 'await' as non-keyword identifiers, 'contextvars', 'nonlocal', 'dataclasses')
async      await      contextvars dataclasses nonlocal

# Python 3.8 keywords (added 'walrus' operator ':=')
:=

# Python 3.9 keywords (added 'match' statement)
match

### Anaconda Navigator: 
Anaconda is a popular open-source distribution of Python and other data science-related packages. It simplifies the process of installing, managing, and updating Python libraries for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. Anaconda includes tools such as conda, a powerful package manager, and provides an environment management system, allowing users to create isolated Python environments for different projects, making it easier to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between packages.
